1.Why write another copy of repo?
Sometimes repo project is hard to set up for someone or small company.
But they can easily set up git server by Gitbucket or Bitbucket.
If they want to split their project into multi repositories, a tool like repo is required.

2.How to use?
1)Add the repositories into the repo_manifest list by manual.
2)Add the prefix of repository url into repo_url_dic, all give it a good name.
3)Run ./repo init "your name"
4)The other commands are look like "repo" of Google
5)...

3.Test?
I have add two test repositories to let simple repo to manage them
This is the forked repo
